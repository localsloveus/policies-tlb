*Information Collection and Use.* Our site collects Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). PII includes information such as your name, address, email address, etc. that you give us when you submit your ballot or submit information to us in an email or through our website. Entering PII is optional, but it allows you to participate in any incentive program(s) we may be offering (free gifts, drawings, etc.) and allows us to customize your experience when you visit our site. We use your PII to send out gift(s) and prize(s), to notify you of voting results and updates to our website, and to provide you with information that may be of value to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please see the "Information Management" section below on how to change your preferences.

PII will be made available to our employees, agents, business partners and contractors for our internal business purposes, as well as to our outside auditors, attorneys, accountants and potential and actual purchasers of our business. The frequency of such information disclosure varies in accordance with our business model. We will not sell or rent PII to any third party except when you have been given the opportunity to "opt-out" of sharing the information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided. In the event you order a product or service, we will share your PII with the third party to fulfill your request or order. We will also disclose PII if we are required to respond to a legal process requiring such disclosure.

We maintain an e-mail list. We use our email list to keep in touch with our customers and viewers and to allow our business partners to contact you with products or services we believe may be of interest to you.

In the unlikely event The Local Best is sold, or substantially all of our assets are sold or acquired, PII would be transferred as part of the assets.

We do not collect PII for anyone under 13. If you are under 13, you may not vote or participate in the use of our web site. In the event you become aware that we may have personal information pertaining to a child, the parent may send an e-mail to us at [info@thelocalbest.com](mailto:info@thelocalbest.com) to review, change and/or delete such information as well as to refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information.

We also collect Aggregate Information ("AI" - like IP addresses, bandwidth utilization, web page requests, etc.) about site usage from our viewers. We use AI primarily for network management, maintenance, performance evaluation and security. This helps us maximize the quality of service we can offer our viewers and customers and improve the value of our site.

*Information Management.* You may alter your PII by logging in to our web site or opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at any time. Subscribers to our e-mail list may modify or terminate their subscriptions in accordance with the instructions at the bottom of each communication that we send, or you may opt-out of all email communications by sending an email to [optout@thelocalbest.com](mailto:optout@thelocalbest.com) from the email address you wish not to receive communications from us or our partners. Removing your name from our email list will not delete your email address from your PII.

*Information Retention.* We maintain PII in our regular business records as long as necessary for our business purposes. Unless we are required by legal process to disclose this information, we will destroy it once it is no longer necessary for our business purposes.

*Data Deletion.* If you would like your data deleted, submit a contact us form ([link](https://thelocalbest.com/contact-us/?market=sioux-falls)) while signed in, select "Other Reason" from the drop-down menu and in the message to us indicate you want your data deleted.

*Security.* We have security measures and procedures in place to safeguard your PII and attempt to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access. And although we strive to minimize our exposure to system and network compromise, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third party "hackers" or other unauthorized persons from illegally or improperly obtaining this information.

You also play an important role in protecting your PII. We encourage you to password protect your computer, protect your PII, and log off your computer when you are done using it. Change your passwords frequently and do not store them on your computer.

*Cookies.* Cookies are small data files that may be stored on your computer or device when you access a website. We use cookies to offer customized services to you, and may, from time to time use pixel tags to help us manage our online advertising, analyze and measure the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns, and track general usage patterns of visitors to our web site.
